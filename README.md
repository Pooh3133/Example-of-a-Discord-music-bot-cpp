# Example-of-a-Discord-music-bot-cpp
Certainly! Here is an example of a Discord music bot written in C++ using the discordpp library:

``` #include <discordpp/discordpp.h>

#include <iostream>

int main() {

  // Replace YOUR_BOT_TOKEN with your bot's token

  discordpp::Bot bot("YOUR_BOT_TOKEN");

  bot.on_message_create = [&](discordpp::Message message) {

    // Check if the message starts with the command prefix "!"

    if (message.content.find("!") == 0) {

      // Split the message into command and arguments

      std::vector<std::string> words = discordpp::split(message.content, ' ');

      std::string command = words[0].substr(1);  // Remove the "!" prefix

      // Handle the "play" command

      if (command == "play") {

        if (words.size() < 2) {

          // If the command doesn't have any arguments, send an error message

          bot.create_message(message.channel_id, "Error: No song specified.");

          return;

        }

        // Join the rest of the message into a single string as the song name

        std::string song_name = discordpp::join(words, ' ', 1);

        // Send a message to the channel saying that the bot is searching for the song

        bot.create_message(message.channel_id, "Searching for `" + song_name + "`...");

        // TODO: Search for the song and play it

      }

    }

  };

  // Connect the bot to the Discord API

  bot.run();

  return 0;

}
```

This code will create a bot that listens for messages starting with the "!" prefix, and will respond to the "play" command by searching for a song and playing it. You will need to replace YOUR_BOT_TOKEN with your bot's token, which you can obtain by following the instructions in the Discord Developer Portal.

Note that this code is just a basic example, and you will likely need to modify it and add additional code to handle things like searching for and playing songs, skipping songs, pausing and resuming playback, and so on.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
